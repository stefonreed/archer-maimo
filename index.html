	During first period i was playing skribble.io to pass the time so I won't get bored.Then second period came i had to finish the work that was due in 3rd, but wasn't going to turn it in until after a school. Then came time for the field trip. We had to wait for at least 20 minutes for the bus. After talking about anything for 20 minutes it finally arrive. I was trying to get to one seater, but had to do role call. Fortunately a got the seat next to the heated seat. While on our way to the place I got bored and hop on PUBG, even though it took almost half my battery life. I couldn’t finish it because we arrive at the place.</font>

	<font color="white">I didn’t like how we to walk in the cold to get to the place. When we went in the place it had a chill vibe in it. Once we got upstairs I immediately saw the ping pong table. Then Mr. Gabe who is our director was kinda boring in my opinion. I feel like he kinda surprise when he saw us coming. I learned a little from him. When the heat was on I felt like every time he say something I nod off. If he had shown us some examples of what the work look without the design and and with the design. When he introduce us to the people that work there, and said that each person a job to do in the project they are working on. When he shown us the basement of the wok his coworkers did</font>

	<font color="yellow">It was kinda funny how they had a vending machine, but we couldn’t but anything from it. After we got done with the tour I was hungry and tired. We again had to wait like 20 minutes in the cold. When she came to get us it was already 5th period at the school. Of course there was a long line in Cookout, and I was hungry. It was ten minutes when I order my food and ate it. Mrs. Sinclair told us we are leaving at 1:07. At 1:05 I got a refill on my drank. I forgot that the bus driver said we couldn’t bring any drinks, so I hid the cup in my jacket. I had to rush my drank so I eat the ice later. I was tired so I took a 15 minute nap on the bus.</font>

	<font color="red">It wasn’t comfortable with all those bumps on the road. We made it back at school around 1:40. My computer was at 4 percent and I had to do a project in my 7th period class. After school was over I had to stay to retake a quiz in pre-cal. I had to redo it because I got my math wrong, so she help my out. I thought forgot my highlighter and almost failed. Until I remember where I put it.</font>
